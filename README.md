# EZ-Garage
In busy cities, it's impossible to find parking spots. Even if you do, it might be really expensive. Living in New York City, I came across with this problem numerous times and I wished there was an app that I can use to find affordable parking spots. This app allows users to rent out their Garage to other people. You can search through your city and see the availables garages. In the future, I wish to add other features where parking spot is not the only option of renting out a garage, but rent out gyms, art studios or any creative ideas that people have for their garages.
