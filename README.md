# EZ-Garage
In busy cities, it's sometimes impossible to find parking spots and even if you do, it might be really expensive. Living in NYC, I came across with this problem numerous times and I wished there was an app that I can use to find affordable parking spots. This app allows users to rent out their Garage to other people. You can search through your city and see the availables garages. In the future, I wish to add other features where parking spot is not the only option of renting out a garage, but rent out gyms, art studios or anything that people are using their garage as.

Try the app yourself! => [EZ-Garage](https://ez-garage-app.herokuapp.com/).
